Note, there's a bit of a chicken before the egg issue here in that, the zone needs to
created, and then the DNS name servers need to be updated on the domain registrar before the
creation of the ACM cerificate.

Running terraform apply once, then updating the DNS name servers (can be seen with `terraform output`), and running again should work.

The creation of the API gateway has been moved, and is currently handled by chalice. Additionally,
the creation of the CNAME (which is handled by terraform), relies on the dev.json file created by
chalice. This file is created by chalice after `chalice deploy`. Terraform populates chalice's config.json.

It may take some time for DNS propogration and ACM certificate validation.

From scratch the steps are:
1. Run terraform apply (may explode due to DNS settings, or CNAME)
1b. If due to DNS settings: Run terraform apply again (this will create the ACM needed for chalice.)
2. Run calice deploy
3. Run terraform apply again (this will create the CNAME)
